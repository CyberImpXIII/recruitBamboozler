# recruitBamboozler
Going to create a script that automates filling out my github graph in a flattering way so that when recruiters take a look they are awed and amazing by my bs, because THEY are bs for not looking at my actual code.


I want to use this project as an excuse to learn more about,

- electron
- js chron
- how to put stuff in the osx menubar

and also to solidify my knowledge with
- node fs stuff
- the github api
- .env file stuff


I realized this is easier as a bash script so I'm learning about cron jobs and other fun stuff.
